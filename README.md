## MediCare Hub – AWS Reliability Architecture

A hands-on AWS project focused on designing a highly available, fault-tolerant, and self-healing architecture for a medical application using Amazon Web Services (AWS) Reliability Pillar best practices.
This project demonstrates how to eliminate single points of failure, handle infrastructure failures automatically, and build production-grade reliability.

## Project Summary

MediCare Hub is a conceptual medical web application that originally lacked fault tolerance.
Any failure in servers, database, or network could lead to application downtime and data unavailability.

In this project, I redesigned the system using AWS Reliability Pillar principles by implementing:

1.Multi-AZ architecture

2.Auto Scaling and self-healing compute

3.Load balancing with health checks

4.Multi-AZ database

5.Shared storage

6.DNS-level routing

The final result is a highly available and resilient system capable of recovering automatically from failures.

## Problem Statement

The original MediCare Hub architecture had single points of failure, such as:
A single EC2 instance
A single database instance
No load balancer
No automatic recovery mechanism

This meant:

If the server failed → application went down
If the database failed → data became unavailable
Manual intervention was required to recover
For a medical application, this level of risk is unacceptable.

## What I Built

To solve these problems, I built a reliability-focused AWS architecture that includes:

A custom VPC with public and private subnets across multiple Availability Zones
EC2 instances managed by an Auto Scaling Group
An Application Load Balancer to distribute traffic and monitor health
A Multi-AZ RDS database for automatic failover
Amazon EFS for shared and durable storage
Route 53 for DNS-level routing and availability
Each layer of the system is designed to fail gracefully and recover automatically.

## Why Reliability Matters

Reliability is critical because:
Infrastructure failures are inevitable
Systems must recover without manual intervention
Downtime can impact users, trust, and business operations
Medical systems must ensure continuous availability

This project follows key reliability principles:

No single point of failure
Automatic failover
Health monitoring
Multi-AZ deployment
Self-healing infrastructure

## ☁️ AWS Services Used

The following AWS services were used to implement this project:

Amazon VPC – Network isolation and control
Amazon EC2 – Application servers
EC2 Launch Template – Standardized instance configuration
Auto Scaling Group – Self-healing and scaling
Application Load Balancer (ALB) – Traffic distribution and health checks
Amazon RDS (Multi-AZ) – Reliable relational database
Amazon EFS – Shared and durable file storage
Amazon Route 53 – DNS routing and health checks

⚠️ Cost Awareness Note

Some AWS services used in this project (such as ALB, NAT Gateway, RDS Multi-AZ, and EFS) were created temporarily for learning and documentation and deleted immediately to remain cost-efficient.

✅ Final Note

This project demonstrates hands-on experience with AWS Reliability Pillar, real-world architectural thinking, and cost-conscious cloud design.
